The specification of the taks is written on the file spec.pdf

 - All peers and the tracker server must be in one LAN 
 - You must create folder "sharedFiles" at the same folder with "src" folder in FTClient and put some files in that folder
 - After running the FTClient, you must enter the ip address of the FTServer

 - One machine may run multiple FTClients, but their scores will be counted together
 - In order to keep scores of the peers, peers should not never change their IP adresses. Peer with new IP address will be counted as a new client.
